# TEST ONE

#### It is a test repository.
Inside this repo, you'll find two tests each one in its folder.
Take your time to do it. When you're done, submit the code.

First Test

Write a function that takes as arguments: an array of distinct integers and an integer (target value).
You need to check if any two numbers of the array sum up to the target value. If that's the case, your function should return those two numbers in array fashion. Otherwise, just return an empty array.

Second Test

Write a function that takes as arguments  two arrays of integers.
Your function needs to determine whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one, returning true or false;
